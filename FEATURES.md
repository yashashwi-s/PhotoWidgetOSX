# Tableau — Features & Roadmap

## Current Version

### Core
- [x] Desktop photo overlay — borderless `NSWindow` at `desktopIcon` level, always behind normal windows
- [x] True aspect ratio — window dimensions match the image exactly. No cropping, no letterboxing
- [x] Multiple independent photos — each gets its own window, position, size, lock state
- [x] Rounded corners (continuous curve) + drop shadow for native macOS widget look
- [x] Drag to reposition anywhere on screen
- [x] Corner resize — drag any of the 4 corners, aspect ratio always locked
- [x] Lock position toggle (right-click or menu bar)
- [x] Cursor feedback — crosshair near corners, open hand in center
- [x] Right-click context menu directly on the photo overlay (Reveal in Finder)

### Floating Mode & Click-Through
- [x] **Window level toggle** — switch between desktop level (behind everything) and floating level (above everything). Stored per photo, persisted across relaunches
- [x] **Click-through** — `ignoresMouseEvents = true` so the photo never steals focus. Click-through is strictly bound to Floating Mode; turning off floating automatically disables click-through
- [x] **Option (⌥) key override** — hold Option to temporarily re-enable interaction on a click-through photo, even when the app is completely inactive
- [x] **Opacity slider** — per-photo 10%–100%. Scroll-wheel on the photo adjusts it quickly

### Naming & Organization
- [x] **Custom photo names** — rename from settings panel or menu bar
- [x] **Replace photo** — swaps the image file but keeps position, size, lock, name, and all settings
- [x] **Duplicate photo** — creates a copy at a slightly offset position
- [x] **Reorder photos** — drag to reorder items in the settings list
- [x] **Reveal in Finder** — right-click any row in settings to jump to the source file or folder

### Aesthetic Controls (Per Photo)
- [x] **Corner radius slider** — 0px (sharp square) to 50px
- [x] **Shadow** — toggle on/off, adjust blur radius and opacity independently
- [x] **Border** — adjustable width (0–5px) with a full color picker
- [x] **Edge fade (vignette)** — subtle gradient fade-to-transparent at photo edges

### Smart Canvas (Folder Mode)
- [x] **Folder import** — point a widget at any folder; only images are used (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF, GIF, WebP, BMP). Non-image files are silently ignored
- [x] **Live folder watcher** — `DispatchSource` monitors the folder for changes in real-time; new images appear automatically
- [x] **Rotation intervals** — On Click, 30 seconds, 5 minutes, Hourly, Daily, Custom
- [x] **Custom rotation interval** — text field for any interval in seconds (minimum 5s)
- [x] **Double-click to advance** — double-click the desktop photo to cycle to the next image (works even when position is locked)
- [x] **Per-image position & size** — each image in a folder remembers its own position and size independently. Drag image A somewhere, switch to B, switch back — A is exactly where you left it
- [x] **GPU-accelerated crossfade** — `CATransition.fade` on the image layer for smooth image transitions
- [x] **Simultaneous frame animation** — window frame and aesthetic layers (border, vignette, corner radius) animate in sync with the crossfade
- [x] **Top-left pin** — window pins its top-left corner during height changes so it doesn't jump
- [x] **Sizing modes** — toggle a folder between "Dynamic Fit" (images resize to their true aspect ratio, each remembers its own size) and "Fixed Frame" (widget stays fixed, images scale and crop to fill)
- [x] **Previous/Next navigation** — step backwards or forwards through folder images from settings or menu bar

### Mission Control Integration
- [x] Windows participate natively in Mission Control (3-fingers up) and App Exposé (3-fingers down) — photos fly away and arrange themselves with other app windows instead of pinning to the desktop background

### App Shell & Settings Panel
- [x] Menu bar agent (`LSUIElement`) — no dock icon, no window clutter
- [x] Full `NSStatusItem` menu: add, show/hide, lock/unlock, remove per photo — with per-photo thumbnails and status badges (hidden, locked, floating, folder)
- [x] **NSMenuDelegate** — menu rebuilds every time it opens, always in sync with state
- [x] Settings window with expandable photo rows, visibility toggle, trash button, and per-photo controls
- [x] **Hover backgrounds** — rows highlight on hover; full-row click target to expand/collapse
- [x] **Grouped settings** — MODE, APPEARANCE, SMART CANVAS sections with uppercase headers
- [x] **Photos.app integration** — pick directly from Photos library via `PhotosPicker` (up to 20 at once)
- [x] Multi-select file picker — JPEG, PNG, HEIC, TIFF supported
- [x] Launch at Login via `SMAppService`
- [x] Hide menu bar icon (reopen from Spotlight/Applications to restore)
- [x] Remove All Photos action in menu bar

### Performance & Persistence
- [x] ~20MB RAM, near-zero CPU at idle — no polling, no background threads except the folder watcher
- [x] Joins all Spaces (`canJoinAllSpaces`, `stationary`)
- [x] All state saved to `~/Library/Application Support/PhotoWidget/photos.json`
- [x] Photos stored as JPEG copies (90% quality) in the same directory
- [x] Position, size, lock state, visibility, all aesthetic settings — all restored on relaunch
- [x] Atomic save on quit (`NSApplication.willTerminate`) and on every drag/resize

### CI/CD
- [x] Local `build.sh` — `--run` installs and launches without opening Xcode, `--release` packages `.zip` and `.dmg`
- [x] GitHub Actions CI — builds on every push and PR to `main`, validates app bundle size
- [x] GitHub Actions Release — automatically builds, packages, and publishes to GitHub Releases on any `v*` tag push

## Later

- [ ] **Per-display profiles** — remember which photos belong to which monitor; hide/restore when display disconnects or reconnects
- [ ] **Space binding** — pin a photo to a specific Space instead of all Spaces
- [ ] **Snap to edges** — magnetic snapping when dragging near screen edges or other photos
- [ ] **Alignment guides** — show temporary guides when a photo aligns with the edge or center of another
- [ ] **Global hotkey** — toggle all photos visible/hidden with a single shortcut
- [ ] **Apple Shortcuts support** — expose actions (add photo, toggle visibility, set opacity) to the Shortcuts app
- [ ] **URL scheme** — `tableau://add?path=...` for integration with other apps
- [ ] **CLI interface** — `tableau add ~/path/to/image.jpg --floating --opacity 0.5`
- [ ] **Animated GIF playback** — render GIFs natively on the desktop
- [ ] **Paste from clipboard** — `⌘V` to instantly create a widget from a clipboard image
- [ ] **Drag & drop onto menu bar icon** — drop an image file directly onto the status item to add it
- [ ] **Live web preview** — embed a `WKWebView` to display a live webpage as a desktop widget
- [ ] **PDF pages** — display a specific page from a PDF
- [ ] **Grid builder** — define rows/columns, drag photos into cells; the whole grid moves as one object
- [ ] **Wallpaper-aware placement** — detect wallpaper's dominant colors and suggest positions to avoid clashing
- [ ] **Automatic theme adaptation** — adjust border color, shadow, and opacity when macOS switches Light/Dark mode
- [ ] **Export/import layout** — save a `.tableau` bundle of all photos, positions, and settings; import on another Mac
- [ ] **iCloud sync** — sync widgets across your Macs (opt-in per photo)
- [ ] **AppleScript dictionary** — full scriptability: add/remove photos, set properties, query state
- [ ] **Raycast extension** — search, toggle, and manage photos directly from Raycast
- [ ] **VoiceOver support** — accessibility labels for all interactive elements
- [ ] **System accent color integration** — apply the user's macOS accent color to UI elements

## Architecture

```
Sources/App/
├── PhotoWidgetOSXApp.swift   # @main — delegates everything to AppDelegate
├── AppDelegate.swift         # NSStatusItem menu (NSMenuDelegate) + settings window lifecycle
├── ContentView.swift         # SwiftUI settings UI (photo list, toggles, PhotosPicker, grouped controls)
├── DesktopPhotoWindow.swift  # Borderless NSWindow + DraggablePhotoView (drag/resize/right-click/crossfade)
├── PhotoItem.swift           # Codable model: all per-photo settings + FolderImageConfig
├── ImageManager.swift        # PhotoManager — add/remove/persist + window creation + folder sync + rotation
├── FolderWatcher.swift       # GCD DispatchSource folder monitor for Smart Canvas
└── Assets.xcassets/
    └── AppIcon.appiconset/   # 16px–1024px icon variants
```

**Storage:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/PhotoWidget/
├── photos.json               # Array of PhotoItem (atomic write, pretty-printed)
│                              # Includes per-image FolderImageConfig for folder photos
└── *.jpg                     # JPEG copies at 90% quality (single-image photos only)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- `NSMenuDelegate.menuNeedsUpdate` rebuilds the menu lazily each time it opens — always in sync
- `FolderImageConfig` stores per-image position/size keyed by filename within each `PhotoItem`
- `CATransition.fade` for GPU-accelerated crossfade, simultaneous with `NSAnimationContext` frame animation
- All SwiftUI animations use `easeInOut` only — no springs, no bounces, matching native macOS feel
- Settings panel uses hover state + background transitions for interactive feedback
- `isReleasedWhenClosed = false` on all `DesktopPhotoWindow` instances to prevent use-after-free on re-show
